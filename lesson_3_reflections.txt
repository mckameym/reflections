When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You would want to use a remote repository when you want to collaborate on something with others. Or perhaps when you want back for your data.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Maybe you don't want to have certain changes sync to your local repository. Maybe they are changes that other people made that youre not sure about.
